## How to design your own networks via this template
1. Create a new python script named **my_own_networks** in the folder of ../src/**networks**.
2. Import **layer** and **kernels**.
3. Design your own networks.
4. Import your network scipt in ../src/networks/**networks.py**, and add your name of designed network into networks list. (This step is not necessary, and networks.py script is just to avoid a error due to a wrong network name.)
5. Modify train json file (../src/config_file/**config_train.json**), and there is a brief [introduction](https://github.com/Charleswyt/tf_audio_steganalysis/tree/master/src/config_file) for the usage of config files.
6. Run.
